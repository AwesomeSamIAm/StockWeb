#I wrote most of the input code, wrote sections of both the output and magichappens parts, and managed the structure of our code
#Annotated input code which I wrote:

  #Twilio variables definition
  global accountSID
	global authToken
	global phoneNumber
	global twilioPhone
	
  #use of python input() functions
	accountSID = input("Account SID: ") #b
	authToken = input("Authorization Token: ") #b
	phoneNumber = input("Phone Number: ") #b
	twilioPhone = input("Twilio Number: ")
	
  #This loop makes sure that all phone number inputs are valid
	while (len(phoneNumber) != 10 or not phoneNumber.isdigit()):
  		print("Phone number should be 10 numbers")
  		phoneNumber = input("Phone Number: ") #b
	while (len(twilioPhone) != 10 or not twilioPhone.isdigit()):
  		print("Twilio number should be 10 numbers")
  		twilioPhone = input("Twilio Number: ") #b

	messageReceived = input("Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Did you receive this message?('yes' or 'no')") #b
  
  #Based on whether they received the message or not, the ask() function tests if they received the text and redirects the user based on that
	def ask(): #b
  		if (messageReceived == "yes"): #b
  			print("Thanks for using the sytem.") #b
  		elif (messageReceived == "no"): #b
  			main() #b
  		else: #b
  			ask() #b
	magic()
